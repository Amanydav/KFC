      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>KFC was founded on a passion for delicious, flavorful fried chicken. In 1930, Colonel Harland Sanders began cooking for travelers at his service station in Corbin, Kentucky. It wasnâ€™t long before he perfected his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices, which would become the hallmark of KFC's fried chicken.</p>
